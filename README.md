# Block collisions

This implementation is motivated by two Youtube video ([Video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEfHFsfGXjs), [Video 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsYwFizhncE)) by the channel 3Blue1Brown. This is a simple implementation that calculated the trajectory and the number of collisions.


TODO:
* Combine the code, that always both trajectory and total number of collisions are in the output.
* Export data in two csv files.
* Adapt `trajectory.py` to the csv input.
